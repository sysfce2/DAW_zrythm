/**
 * @brief Sets a clip's clip-start / loop-start / loop-end to absolute content
 * positions, undoably.
 *
 * The command is immutable once constructed: it captures the clip's current
 * state as @c before_ at construction and applies the given target on
 * @c redo(). There is deliberately no "update the target while on the stack"
 * pathway — live dragging is handled by mutating the clip directly during the
 * gesture and constructing (and pushing) a single command at the end (see
 * @ref actions::ClipOperator).
 *
 * The clip is held by a reference-counted @ref TypedUuidReference, so it stays
 * alive while the command is on the undo stack.
